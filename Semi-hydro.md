# Semi-Hydro
## Equipment
### Substrates
Use smaller material for plants with tiny roots, use bigger material for plants with bigger roots.
Also keep in mind the weight of the plant, a high heavy cactus might easily fall over in Leca.

The list below is ranked from global preferences:
1. Lechuza PON (Has nutrients for the first +-6months!)
2. Lechuza BASIC PON (No nutrients!)
3. Leca (No nutrients!)
4. Pumice (No nutrients!)
5. Zeolite (No nutrients!)
6. Lava rocks (No nutrients!)
7. Perlite (No nutrients!) (Very lightweight!)
### Self-watering or nursery/grow inserts/pots
* [Hydroculture pots (Amazon BE)](https://www.amazon.com.be/Hydrocultuurmanden-plantenbakken-kunststof-herbruikbaar-hydrocultuur/dp/B07MFTB1DX/ref=sr_1_53_sspa)
    * Preferred to be transparant for easy monitoring of the roots.
* [Self-watering inserts (Elho BE)](https://www.elho.com/be/producten/self-watering-insert/self-watering-insert-28cm-living-black/?scroll=305)
    * Important note: Look at the following diagram below.

### Optional
* Wicks (when nursery/self-watering pots don’t have “feets” to wick up the water)
    * In general people like to use wicks in particular with leca
### Outer (decorative) pots
Any non draining outer pot will be fine
### Fertilizer
Only after a few weeks of normal watering after converting.
Use non-organic fertilizer and make sure it does not contain “Ureum”.
If cutting was grown on water, you don’t need to water it normally, as the roots are already adapted for water instead of soil.

## How
### Plants on soil
#### Converting
1. Remove soil
2. Rinse the roots
3. Remove dead roots (if any)
4. Put your substrate in your grow/self-watering pot to about 1/3th
5. Plant your plant on the substrate
6. Cover with more substrate
#### Watering
1. Water the plant on top of the substrate, like how you would do when it’s potted in soil. This will make sure that the roots can adapt to the semi-hydro process instead of soil
2. After a few weeks, start watering by filling the reservoir or outer (decorative) pot to about the bottom or 1/3th of the nursery/grow pot
### Cuttings on water
#### Converting
1. Put your substrate in your grow/self-watering pot to about 1/3th
2. Plant your plant on the substrate
3. Cover with more substrate
4. Fill the self-watering reservoir or add water to your non-draining outer (decorative) pot
#### Watering
1. Start watering by filling the reservoir or outer (decorative) pot to about the bottom or 1/3th of the nursery/grow pot
## Tips and tricks
* Let the plant acclimate at your home first, the longer the better.
* Fertilize heavy feeding plants with every watering (depending on conditions like grow light, warmth, ..)
* Monstera Deliciosa like a chunky mix of substrate for their roots. This results in lower risk of root rot.
* Use pots with wicks or the feet system so in both cases the roots won't be sitting in water unless they grow into the reservoir. I take that as a sign to readjust the roots, but you can also just cut them off
* Roots that were grown in soil should not be submerged with water, they will rot
* New developed roots that were on a substrate will be adapted to be in water, I call these water roots and these can be submerged. This will require that these roots are always submerged in water or there’s a chance of them drying up and rotting eventually
