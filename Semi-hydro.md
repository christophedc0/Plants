# Semi-Hydro

## Equipment

### Substrates

Use smaller material for plants with tiny roots, use bigger material for plants with bigger roots.  
Also keep in mind the weight of the plant, a high heavy cactus might easily fall over in Leca.

The list below is ranked from global preferences:
1. __Lechuza PON__ (Has nutrients for the first +-6months!)
2. __Lechuza BASIC PON__ (No nutrients!)
3. __Leca__ (No nutrients!)
4. __Pumice__ (No nutrients!)
5. __Zeolite__ (No nutrients!)
6. __Lava rocks__ (No nutrients!)
7. __Perlite__ (No nutrients!) (Very lightweight!)

#### CoPilot Comparison table (1-7)

| Substrate | Composition | Key Features | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lechuza PON** | Zeolite, pumice, lava | Pre-fertilized, volume-stable, pest-free, optimal air/water ratio | Houseplants, large planters |
| **Lechuza BASIC PON** | Pumice, lava, zeolite | Not pre-fertilized, volume-stable, pH-stable, pest-free | Sensitive plants, cuttings |
| **Leca**        | Expanded clay | Lightweight, porous, reusable, pathogen-free | Hydroponics, aquaponics |
| **Pumice**      | Volcanic rock | | Lightweight, porous, retains moisture, pest-free | Horticulture, bonsai |
| **Zeolite**     | Microporous, aluminosilicate minerals| Water retention, ion-exchange, pest-free | Agriculture, water purification |
| **Lava rocks**  | Volcanic rock | Lightweight, porous, pest-free | Hydroponics, drainage |
| **Perlite**     | Volcanic glass | Lightweight, porous, moisture retention, pest-free | Soil amendment, hydroponics |

8. __Fluval Stratum__

   Super nutrient rich substrate originally used in aquariums, but which people use for sprouting corms, rooting props, and rehabilitating stressed/damaged plant(s).  
   It encourages root growth a ton and has the plant grow water roots which is great for moving them to semihydro later.  

   *I'm currently trying this out but with an alternative solution named, __Flora Base Pro__.*  
   *According to CoPilot, __ADA Aquasoil__ would also be a good alternative.*

#### CoPilot Comparison table (8):
| Feature | Fluval Stratum | Flora Base Pro | ADA Aquasoil |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Composition** | Volcanic soil from Mount Aso in Japan, clay-based | Blend of natural clay and organic materials | Baked soil granules, Japanese plant-based black soil |
| **Nutrient Content** | Contains essential nutrients and minerals | Rich in nutrients, often includes beneficial bacteria | Extremely rich in organic nutrients and necessary elements |
| **pH Buffering** | Helps maintain a stable pH level | Helps maintain a stable pH level | Lowers pH and KH levels, creating a perfect environment for plants |
| **Weight** | Lightweight and porous | Generally lightweight | Lightweight, uniform grain size |
| **Water Quality** | Does not leach ammonia | Inert, doesn't alter water chemistry significantly | Retains nutrients and releases them slowly, captures dirt floating in water |
| **Plant Support** | Good for root growth and stability | Good for anchoring plants and promoting root growth | Promotes fast-growing roots, holds them in place |
| **Cons** | More expensive, may need rinsing before use | More expensive, may need rinsing before use | Can lower pH significantly, may require adjustment |

### Self-watering or nursery/grow inserts/pots

* [Hydroculture pots (Amazon BE)](https://www.amazon.com.be/Hydrocultuurmanden-plantenbakken-kunststof-herbruikbaar-hydrocultuur/dp/B07MFTB1DX/ref=sr_1_53_sspa)
    * Preferred to be transparant for easy monitoring of the roots.

* [Self-watering inserts (Elho BE)](https://www.elho.com/be/producten/self-watering-insert/self-watering-insert-28cm-living-black/?scroll=305)
    * Important note: Look at the following diagram below.

### Optional

* Wicks (when nursery/self-watering pots don’t have “feets” to wick up the water)
    * In general people like to use wicks in particular with leca

### Outer (decorative) pots

Any non draining outer pot will be fine

### Fertilizer

Only after a few weeks of normal watering after converting.  
Use non-organic fertilizer and make sure it does not contain “Ureum”.  
If cutting was grown on water, you don’t need to water it normally, as the roots are already adapted for water instead of soil.

## How

### Plants on soil

#### Converting
1. Remove soil.
2. Rinse the roots.
3. Remove dead roots (if any).
4. Put your substrate in your grow/self-watering pot to about 1/3th.
5. Plant your plant on the substrate.
6. Cover with more substrate.
   
#### Watering

1. Water the plant on top of the substrate, like how you would do when it’s potted in soil.  
   This will make sure that the roots can adapt to the semi-hydro process instead of soil.
3. After a few weeks, start watering by filling the reservoir or outer (decorative) pot to about the bottom or 1/3th of the nursery/grow pot.
   
### Cuttings on water

#### Converting

1. Put your substrate in your grow/self-watering pot to about 1/3th.
2. Plant your plant on the substrate.
3. Cover with more substrate.
4. Fill the self-watering reservoir or add water to your non-draining outer (decorative) pot.

#### Watering

1. Start watering by filling the reservoir or outer (decorative) pot to about the bottom or 1/3th of the nursery/grow pot.

## Tips and tricks

* Let the plant acclimate at your home first, the longer the better.
* Fertilize heavy feeding plants with every watering (depending on conditions like grow light, warmth, ..)
* Monstera Deliciosa like a chunky mix of substrate for their roots. This results in lower risk of root rot.
* Use pots with wicks or the feet system so in both cases the roots won't be sitting in water unless they grow into the reservoir.  
  I take that as a sign to readjust the roots, but you can also just cut them off.
* Roots that were grown in soil should not be submerged with water, they will rot.
* New developed roots that were on a substrate will be adapted to be in water, I call these water roots and these can be submerged.  
  This will require that these roots are always submerged in water or there’s a chance of them drying up and rotting eventually.
